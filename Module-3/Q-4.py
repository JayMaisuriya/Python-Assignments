''' Differentiate between append () and extend () methods?

Ans :

append(): Adds its argument as a single element to the end of the list. 
          If the argument is a list, it will be added as a single element.

extend(): Iterates over its argument and adds each element to the list, extending the list. 
          If the argument is a list, its elements will be added individually.
