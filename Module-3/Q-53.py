''' How do you perform pattern matching in Python? Explain.

Ans :

Pattern matching in Python is using a toolbox called the "re" module.
Imagine it's like looking for a special pattern or a specific word in a sentence.
It helps find, replace, or take out specific pieces of a sentence following certain rules.
You make a special plan using special tools, then use it on the sentence to find what matches.
It's really helpful for dealing with words and sentences.
